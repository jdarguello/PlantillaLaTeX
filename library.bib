abstract = {A pellet mill comprises a die which may rotatably be driven by a suitable drive. At least one press roller engages the inner surface of this die, and material to be pelleted is fed to this press roller by means of a deflector blade situated before. This deflector blade is arranged at least 45° before the related press roller--as seen in the direction of the rotation of the die--so that a free space of at least 45° will result therebetween. Within this free space, the centrifugal force due to the rotation of the die becomes effective and contributes to a better distribution of the material.},

abstract = {Soluble flaxseed gum (SFG) extracted at different temperatures (25, 40, and 60 °C) was analyzed in relation to the yield, polysaccharides and phenolics composition, surface charge, color, and rheological properties. The yield of SFG extract increased as the extraction temperature increased. The SFG xylan was the main component regardless the extraction temperature, but a reduction of substituents on the xylose chain was observed when increasing the extraction temperature. The phenolic compounds were also affected by the extraction temperature, influencing the antioxidant capacity of the gum. For all the extraction temperatures, SFG aqueous solutions showed a shear time-independent and shear-thinning behavior. Furthermore, oscillatory measurements showed a prevailing viscous character, but the decrease of the extraction temperature resulted in an increase of both G' and G". Therefore, SFG extracted at low extraction temperatures showed higher viscous and elastic properties, while high extraction temperatures increased the antioxidant activity.},

abstract = {Prediction of continuous steady-state ball milling using the traditional population balance model requires knowledge of several functions, namely those describing the rate and distribution of breakage products, the mass transfer relationship between the mill hold-up and the discharge, the mode of transport within the mill, as well as the description of internal classification, whenever present. In spite of its long track record, there are comparatively few instances in which the population balance model of continuous ball milling has been validated in great detail under controlled conditions. The work analyzes how confidently one can predict continuous milling in a dry open-circuit pilot-scale operating under a wide range of feed rates, mill speeds, fillings and feed materials (an iron ore and a spent catalyst) using the population balance model. It relies on measured residence time distribution of the solids, the Austin model of grinding and the expressions recently proposed by Nomura to describe mass transfer from the mill to the discharge to predict continuous grinding. Breakage parameters of the materials studied were estimated on the basis of batch grinding tests. Parameters in Nomura's transport model were fitted on the basis of a few selected continuous tests and were used to estimate the mill hold up operating under a range of conditions. A comparison between experiments and predictions demonstrated that errors in the measurements of hold-up were, on the average, 6.0{\%}, whereas those associated to the 80{\%} passing size of the product were smaller than 5.6{\%}.},

abstract = {Biomass raw materials are widely regarded as a significant source of renewable energy, which significantly reduces the dependence on traditional fossil fuels, especially in the case of countries that are able to obtain biomass from various sources. Recently, pelletization has been widely used for mass and energy densification of biomass to overcome the problems associated with raw material use. As the global pellet market has developed quickly, the use of wood residues became no longer sufficient to fulfill the market needs. The standards of pellets provide limits for both physical and mechanical characteristics of produced pellets. Characteristics of produced pellets depend mainly on the feedstock characteristics as particle size and moisture content and operating conditions as applied pressure and die temperature. Thus, this paper provides rich information on the factors affecting the physical and mechanical properties of granules included in pellets. The main goal of the paper is to review the latest and comprehensive research on the physical and mechanical properties of most types of single and mixed pellets from biomass. The analysis of the effect of properties, adhesives, humidity, pressure and temperature as well as the physical and mechanical properties of the pellets studied was carried out. In addition, the critical and optimal values of various factors for different materials in which the following is of importance: high quality of pellets and biomass from which they are produced were analyzed. The principle and effect of applying post-production conditions as steam explosion and torrefaction on the characteristics of the pellets were reviewed in details. Moreover, this study proposes some recommendations for further development of the pelletization analysis and characteristics.},

abstract = {Crushing is a key step during olive oil extraction. Among commercial crushers, the hammer mill is the most widely used due to its robustness and high throughput. In the present work, the impact of hammer mill rotor speed on extraction yield and overall quality of super-high-density Arbosana olive oils were assessed in an industrial facility. Our results show that increasing the rotor speed from 2400rpm to 3600rpm led to a rise in oil yield of 1.2{\%}, while conserving quality parameters. Sensory analysis showed more pungency with increased rotation speed, while others attributes were unaffected. Volatile compounds showed little variation with the differences in crusher speed; however, total phenols content, two relevant secoiridoids, and triterpenoids levels increased with rotor speed. Hammer mill rotor speed is a processing variable that can be tuned to increase the extraction efficiency and modulate the chemical composition of extra virgin olive oil.},

abstract = {Vacuum evaporation is an efficient method for reducing the volume of liquid digestate (LD) from biogas plants (BGP). Furthermore, thickening LD in BGP contributes to the efficient utilization of waste heat and also reduces fossil fuel consumption that is needed for transporting LD. However, the utilization of vacuum evaporation must be reasonable, and a comprehensive study should precede the integration of evaporation technology in a particular BGP. For this purpose, this study compares selected parameters of three types of industrial evaporators which may be suitable for LD thickening. Furthermore, this study provides a mathematical model that describes the mass and energy balances of the chosen evaporators and is able to evaluate their energy performance for a given set of input variables. It was concluded that the forced-circulation evaporator has the highest energy requirements and also requires a high cooling performance. This type of evaporator will be interesting for the plant owners only if the cost of power generation is extremely low. In terms of consumption of energy and cooling duty, the multi-stage flash evaporator is the most efficient and it also requires the least heat transfer area. The falling-film evaporator provides only slightly worse performance.},

An optimization study was performed using ethanol as a solvent and with extraction pressure (5–10MPa), temperature (313–393K) and static extraction time (3–15min) as independent variables. The optimum PLE conditions for all response variables were estimated; however, PLE conditions resulting in the highest recovery of anthocyanins (5MPa, 553K and 9min of static extraction time) were chosen for comparison with a conventional low-pressure solvent extraction (LPSE). The attributes compared were yield, content of anthocyanins and phenolic compounds and economic feasibility. Similar extraction yields were obtained by LPSE and PLE under optimized conditions; however 2.15 and 1.66-fold more anthocyanins and total phenolic compounds, respectively, were extracted using PLE, while the cost of manufacturing (COM) obtained for the PLE extract was 40-fold lower.},

The feed sample directly leached in different lixiviants yielded low potash dissolution values. Planetary ball milling was carried out to liberate the potash values from silicate matrix. Leaching was adopted to assess the liberated K values and within milling time of 10–12 h almost 90{\%} potash was leached out. Based on XRD analysis, orthoclase and phlogopite were found to be the toughest potash – bearing phase in terms of dissociation. Compared to other processes, mechanical activation process adopted in this work is simple, environment-friendly and minimal waste generation without using the chemical additive.},

Matrix solid phase dispersion (MSPD) has found particular application as a somewhat generic analytical process for the preparation, extraction and fractionation of solid, semi-solid and/or highly viscous biological samples. Its simplicity and flexibility contribute to it being chosen over more classical methods for these purposes. MSPD is based on several simple principles of chemistry and physics, involving forces applied to the sample by mechanical blending to produce complete sample disruption and the interactions of the sample matrix with a solid support bonded-phase (SPE) or the surface chemistry of other solid support materials. These principles are discussed as are the factors to be considered in conducting a MSPD extraction. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This study assesses the changes in physical properties (particle size, shape, density) of Austrian pine (softwood) and European beech (hardwood), as they are mechanically processed from wood chips to pellets and then to milled pellets. A series of semi-industrial hammer mills and a semi-industrial pellet mill were used. The specific pelletizing and grinding energy, as well as the pellet mill and hammer mill capacity, were determined. Size, shape, and bulk density of the wood particles obtained at each processing step were studied. The pellet quality was analyzed according to international standards. Results show that the pelletization modifies the internal pellet particle shape and length due to the breakage of particles across their longest dimension, leading to more circular and less elongated particles. However, the particle width was nearly unaffected, indicating a directional fracture behavior for wood particles during pelletization. The particle breaking effect was more dominant for beech particles. Beech contained a lower amount of extractives than pine that led to higher specific pelletizing energy. In addition, beech pellets had a lower quality concerning durability and density. Relationships between specific grinding energies and characteristic product particle sizes were also determined. E.g., the specific energy for grinding pine pellets was about 10 kWh/t oven-dry wood for a characteristic product size of 0.8 mm, while grinding beech pellets required about 7 kWh/t oven-dry wood for a characteristic product size of 0.6 mm. The study concludes that less energy is needed to pelletize pine than beech under the same processing conditions, but more energy is needed to mill pine than beech.},

However, the fermentable sugar containing the soybean needs to be released from the solid matrix through different processes. Against this backdrop, the present study explores the use of high-energy ball milling as a one-step treatment method for expedited production of fermentable sugars of textured soybean. The best result is observed after only 5 min of milling, obtaining 34.1 times more fermentable sugars than untreated textured soybean, and 2.5 times more than commercially used soybean meal. Notably, the textured soybean ball-milled has been used as a substrate for Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki HD-73 fermentation. The cell and spore production is also compared with a standard Rowe media. The maximum cell concentration obtained in the entire fermentation process using ball-milled textured soybean media is found to be higher than the concentration obtained using the standard Rowe media. In addition, it is observed that there is a direct correlation between maximum cell production and reducing sugar concentration generated by the high-energy ball milling treatment. No fermentation inhibitors or by-products are generated during the physical treatment.},

In this stud y, we investigated the hormonal profile of murine fluorescence-activated cell sortingsorted duodenal I cells using semiquantitative RT-PCR, liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, and immunostaining methods. We report that I cells are enriched in mRNA transcripts encoding CCK and also other key gut hormones, including neurotensin, glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), secretin, peptide YY, proglucagon, and ghrelin (Ghrl). Furthermore, liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis of fluorescence-activated cell sortingpurified I cells and immunostaining confirmed the presence of these gut hormones in duodenal I cells. Immunostaining highlighted that subsets of I cells in both crypts and villi coexpress differential amounts of CCK, Ghrl, GIP, or peptide YY, indicating that a proportion of I cells contain several hormones during maturation and when fully differentiated. Our results reveal that although I cells express several key gut hormones, including GIP or proglucagon, and thus have a considerable overlap with classically defined K and L cells, approximately half express Ghrl, suggesting a potentially important subset of duodenal EEC cells that require further consideration.

abstract = {The effect of crude glycerol (G) on the pelletizing process and the quality of biomasses pellets were evaluated. Pellets were made of three types of agro-industrial biomasses typical of tropical countries: Sugarcane bagasse (SCB), Coffee Husk (CH) and Rice Husk (RH). Mixtures of water and glycerol were used as a binder. It was found that, with the addition of crude glycerin, the linkages between biomass particles for formation of pellets is made easier. However, this addition causes a reduction of the compaction degree since it acts as a lubricant between the biomass and the pelletization die, which produces the weakening of the solid to solid interaction. For CH and SCB particles, due to its shape and soft structure, pelletizing is not significantly affected by the biomass particle size variation, whereas in the case of small RH particles, the presence of a binder favors pelletizing. A brief dissertation about the aggregation mechanisms those were favored in each biomass type was carried out. A multi-criteria methodology was implemented by which it was possible to select the optimal conditions of pelletizing for each biomass.},

abstract = {This work studied the effect of pelletization on the SuperCritical (SC) carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) extraction yield of rosemary antioxidant fractions enriched in phenolic compounds. Dried rosemary leaves were depleted of essential oils by SC-CO 2 extraction and a portion of the resulting pre-extracted leaves (control substrate) enriched in phenolic compounds was pelletized. A factorial experimental design (2 3 ) was carried out: control substrate and pellets were extracted at two temperatures (40 and 70 °C), and two extraction pressures (30 and 50 MPa). Pelletizing decreased the extraction yield from 4.28{\%} to 1.33{\%}. However, the volumetric yield (mass of recovered solute per unit time and per unit volume of extraction bed) of pellets was 34{\%} higher than that of control substrate. Pelletization also decreased the antioxidant activity of the extracts, which was attributed to the high temperatures generated during the process. A linear correlation (R 2 = 0.83) between the antioxidant activity and the dominant rosemary phenolic carnosic acid was observed. Sovov{\'{a}}'s broken-and-intact cell model was applied to a selection of pellet and control substrate extraction curves to determine a microstructural factor (MF = D e /D 12 ) as best-fitting parameter. Resulting value of MF was 0.0003 for control substrate and 0.0027 for pellets. The simulation of the SC-CO 2 extraction of pellets with twice the specific surface showed that a decrease of particle size can increase considerably the extraction rate and yield of the pellets. We propose pelletization, under certain restrictions of particle size and process temperature, as a way of improving rosemary antioxidant extraction yield.},

abstract = {The extraction efficiency of bioactive compounds along with their biological activity and stability depends on the extraction temperature and time. The effects of extraction temperature (60–90 °C) and time (15–180 min) on the total soluble solids (TSS) content, antioxidant activity, and curcuminoids of aqueous turmeric extracts were studied. The stability of extracts based on curcuminoid degradation, loss of antioxidant activity and color was also investigated by further heat treatment at 90 °C and 25 °C for 48 h. The TSS showed temperature dependency, reached a maximum value within 60 min and then plateaued for all temperatures. The maximum TSS and curcuminoid concentration were obtained at an extraction temperature and time of 90 °C and 60 min, respectively. Antioxidant activity increased with both increasing temperature and time. After infusing the extracts at 90 °C for 1 h followed by separation, further heat treatment at 90 °C for 48 h resulted in curcuminoid degradation and reduced antioxidant activity while no changes were observed in extracts kept at 25 °C for the same time. High extraction temperature for appropriate time results in high TSS and high antioxidant activity. However, excessive heat treatment led to the degradation of curcuminoids and reductions in antioxidant activity.},

The functionality of the plant was verified by a prototype that process 1 kilograms per lot. It was tested both the obtained product (extract mass and chemical composition) as the prototype itself (functionality, consumed energy and confiability). Based on the results obtained by the prototype, is possible to optimize, through a numerical simulation, the functionality of the designed extraction plant to obtain lower granulometric values that the ones obtained by the prototype during the crushing process and the time that is needed for the filtration process.
